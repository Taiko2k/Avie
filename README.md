 - The thumbnail preview shows the output exactly as it would be at 184x184
 - Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to move the selection rectangle slowly
 - Tap <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to enter free rectangle mode
 - Click the preview to toggle between ***square*** and ***circle*** (The final output will always be square)
